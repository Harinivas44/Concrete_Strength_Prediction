# Concrete Strength Prediction üèóÔ∏è

#### Overview:
Predicting the compressive strength of concrete is crucial for ensuring the durability and stability of structures. In this project, I use various machine learning algorithms to predict concrete compressive strength based on different input features.

#### Dataset:
The dataset consists of 1030 samples with 9 features:

- **Inputs:**
  - Cement
  - Blast Furnace Slag
  - Fly Ash
  - Water
  - Superplasticizer
  - Coarse Aggregate
  - Fine Aggregate
  - Age

- **Output:**
  - Concrete Compressive Strength

#### Data Exploration:
- Checked for missing values and data types.
- Explored descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
- Visualized feature correlations using a heatmap.

#### Data Preprocessing:
- Handled outliers using the IQR method to improve model performance.
- Scaled input features to ensure uniformity across different scales.
